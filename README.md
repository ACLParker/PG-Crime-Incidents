# PG Crime Incidents
 Prince George's County Crime Incidents Web Application

Description: This project uses Prince George's County Open Data API to access the Crime Incidents February 2017 to Present Dataset in order to answer important questions such as:
- Has there been an increase of crime in Prince George's County within the past few years?
- Which year has the most amount of crime incidents occurred?
- Which crime incidents occurred most frequently for each month of the years?
- Do some months exhibit higher crime rates than others?
Using the information from the dataset, we created a data visualization that calculated the total number of each type of crime incidents that occurred within a given month in a given year.
