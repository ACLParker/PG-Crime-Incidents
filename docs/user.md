## User Manual

This web application answers the question of whether there is a trend in the amount of crime incidents that occurred in Prince George's County over the past few recent years. This is done through the use of a bar graph that shows the total number of crime incidents per month in each year starting from February 2017. Our stakeholders would use this application to see which types of crime incidents occurred the most throughout the past months and years. This allows for our stakeholders to be aware of what is happening in their community, be prepared and possibly take a course of action to tackle this problem.

**How to Use the Application**
Once the website is loaded, at the bottom of the site there is a menu bar with the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 listed. On the right side of that menu bar, there is a dropdown menu with a list of months of the year. 

1) *Click on a year* (2017, 2018, 2019). A bar graph will pop up showing the total number of crimes for each crime incident type within that year.
2) *Click on a month* (Jan - Dec). This will do a deeper dive into the data. Whichever month you choose, the total number of crimes for each crime incident type within your already selected year will display.
3) *Repeat Steps 1-2 with different years and months*. The data and the title of the graph changes to the month and years you select so you can compare data of different times.

***NOTE***
This dataset goes as far back up to February 2017. If the user selects January for 2017, no data will be shown on the graph because this data does not exist. Also, this dataset updates weekly, there will be an absent of data within the first week of a new month. For example: No information for the month of December was shown from December 1st to December 7th. There had yet to be data for December.
